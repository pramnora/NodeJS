# NODEJS MODULES  

NodeJS, allows one to break up Javascript extension files: [.js] into being a number of seperate modules.  

This modular coding technique also allows one to build libraries of reusable functions.../-etc.

## PROBLEMS I'M HAVING TO GO FIGURE OUT, AT THE MOMENT...  

So, far to date, I've managed to figure out how to get the code modules to return back single results;  
however, I've still not managed to figure out how it would return say the ouput of a loop...;  
one possible solution, I suppose, would be to build a single 'output string'; and, then, return that back;  
however, I'm not sure if there might be a better way around it.
